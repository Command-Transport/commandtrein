## Installation

#### 1. Install via `go install`

To quickly install commandtrein using go, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/Kaya-Sem/commandtrein@latest
```

This will download and install commandtrein and make it available in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. Ensure that this directory is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

#### 2. Compiled binaries

[releases](https://github.com/Kaya-Sem/commandtrein/releases) (windows is untested)

#### 3. Install from source
If you prefer to build commandtrein from source, follow these steps:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Kaya-Sem/commandtrein.git
cd commandtrein
go build -o commandtrein
sudo mv commandtrein /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

Commandtrein supports the following actions:

#### Display timetable / liveboard for a station

```bash
commandtrein <station> # shows timetable for station
```

*Example:*
```bash
commandtrein Gent-Sint-Pieters
```
#### Find connections between two stations
```bash
commandtrein <station1> to <name2>
```
*Example:*
```bash
commandtrein Gent-Sint-Pieters to Zingem
```

this command will display the avaible connections, including departure and arrival times, duration, and platform information.


#### List all SNCB stations
```bash
commandtrein search
```

To filter results, you will have to use tools like grep. Filtering is planned in upcoming releases


#### Tab completion
Tab completion is currently only implemented for bash. 

<details>
<summary>Bash</summary>
  
To get tab completion for bash, download the file located here in `completions/bash_completion.sh`, and source it in your .bashrc:
```sh
source /PATH/TO/bash_completion.sh
```
> ⚠️
> The script currently assumes that your executable is called `commandtrein`.
> You can either rename your binary, or change the bash-file at line 14 and 19.

The completion uses the `mkdir`, `mapfile`, `grep` and `complete` commands, which should all be installed by default on your system.
The completions are sourced from the `commandtrein search` command, and are cached in "$HOME/.config/commandtrein/" to prevent having to query for the data (~160ms) every time. Caches are updated once a month, but you can update it forcefully by removing all the cache-files: `rm "$HOME/.config/commandtrein/*"`

#### Acknowledgements

Commandtrein leverages the iRails API, an open-source API for accessing real-time data from SNCB.
